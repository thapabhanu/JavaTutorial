# JavaTutorial - Object Oriented Programming

<h2> What is Object Oriented Programming ?</h2>
Object Oriented programming is a programming style which is associated with the concepts like class, object, Inheritance, Encapsulation, Abstraction, Polymorphism. Java, C++ follow an object-oriented programming paradigm.

<h2>Concepts of Object oriented Programming</h2>

<h2>OOP: Inheritance</h2>
Inheritance in Java is a mechanism in which one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent object. Types of inheritance - Single inheritance, Multilevel inheritance, Hierarchical Inheritance.

<h2>OOP: Encapsulation</h2>
Encapsulation is a mechanism where you bind your data and code together as a single unit. It also means to hide your data in order to make it safe from any modification.

We can achieve encapsulation in Java by:<br>
	&emsp;Declaring the variables of a class as private.<br>
	&emsp;Providing public setter and getter methods to modify and view the variables values.

<h2>OOP: Abstraction</h2>
Abstraction is a process of hiding the implementation details and showing only functionality to the user.
Another way, it shows only essential things to the user and hides the internal details, for example, sending Email where you type the text and send the email. You don't know the internal processing about the email delivery.

You can achieve abstraction in two ways:<br>
	&emsp;a) Abstract Class<br>
	&emsp;b) Interface
	
<h2>OOP: Polymorphism</h2>
Polymorphism means taking many forms, where ‘poly’ means many and ‘morph’ means forms. It is the ability of a variable, function or object to take on multiple forms. In other words, polymorphism allows you define one interface or method and have multiple implementations.

Polymorphism in Java is of two types: <br>

&emsp;Run time polymorphism<br>
&emsp;Compile time polymorphism<br>

<b>Run time polymorphism</b>: In Java, runtime polymorphism refers to a process in which a call to an overridden method is resolved at runtime rather than at compile-time.

<b>Compile time polymorphism</b>: In Java, compile time polymorphism refers to a process in which a call to an overloaded method is resolved at compile time rather than at run time.

Unlike method overriding, arguments can differ in:

&emsp;Number of parameters passed to a method<br>
&emsp;Datatype of parameters<br>
&emsp;Sequence of datatypes when passed to a method.<br>
